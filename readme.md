# Early-Math-Prototype-Player
Play the Early Math Prototypes embedded in an iPad app.

Running the app on your iPad:

- Get Xcode from the Mac App Store if you don't already have it
- Clone this git repository to your computer.
    - If you're not familiar with git, you can use the Github app to do it.
    - Alternatively, you can do the following from the Terminal app
            
            git clone --recursive git@github.com:Khan/Early-Math-Prototype-Player.git
- Open the project file (Early Math Prototype Player.xcodeproj) in Xcode
- Make sure you pick the correct app to run and device in Xcode if it's not already chosen.

This project uses git submodules, so make sure you get them all before you build:

    git submodule update --init --recursive
